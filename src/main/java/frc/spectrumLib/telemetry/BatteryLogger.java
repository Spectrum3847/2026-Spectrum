 * Tracks and logs current draw, power, and cumulative energy consumption across subsystems each

 * cached per channel name, so steady-state operation performs no string splitting or concatenation.
 * The set of channel names is small and fixed after the first loop.
 *
 * <p>Only current is published every loop. Power and energy are published at {@link
 * #SLOW_LOG_PERIOD_SECONDS}, because this class is the single largest producer of log records on
 * the robot and the loop period tracks that volume almost linearly. In the 2026-09-05 18:38 log it
 * accounted for 32.3 of the 94 records written per loop -- a third of everything -- while the loop
 * ran at 33 Hz with a median period of 27.4 ms. Current is the channel worth watching live; power
 * is current times pack voltage and energy is its integral, so neither needs 50 Hz to stay useful.
