/**
 * A cap on how long boot may spend on CAN device configuration that is not working.
 *
 * <p>Every Phoenix configuration call blocks until the device answers or the timeout expires. That
 * is invisible when the bus is healthy and quadratic in frustration when it is not: each of the
 * roughly two dozen CANivore devices is configured with several such calls, plus retry loops on top
 * of them, and every one of those waits out its full timeout against a device that is not there.
 *
 * <p>In the 2026-09-19 Chezy practice match the CANivore bus went down mid-match on a cut wire. The
 * roboRIO was restarted from the Driver Station and the code looked like it never came back: robot
 * init took <b>64.0 s</b> against 16.9 s in the match before it, and the rio then sat at 93-99% CPU
 * with 58-77% of loops over 25 ms. It had in fact come back -- it was just unusable, and the match
 * was over before anyone could tell the difference.
 *
 * <p>This class bounds that. Callers run their configuration through {@link #run} and consult
 * {@link #exhausted()} before retrying or before making calls that are merely nice to have. Once
 * the cumulative time lost to failed configuration passes {@link #BUDGET_SECONDS}, the budget is
 * spent: retries stop, optional calls are skipped, and an alert names it. Boot then completes with
 * a dead bus in roughly the time it takes to fail once per device instead of ten times.
 *
 * <p>The cap is deliberately cause-agnostic. A cut wire, a powered-down bus, a wrong bus name and a
 * missing CANivore all present identically here, and the correct response to all of them is the
 * same: stop waiting and come up.
