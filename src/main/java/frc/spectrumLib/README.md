# SpectrumLib

Reusable robot library shared across Spectrum teams (3847, 8515, Flash, etc.). Contains framework abstractions, hardware wrappers, telemetry utilities, and simulation helpers designed to carry forward year-to-year.

## Packages

### `framework`
Core structural interfaces and base classes.

| Class | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `SpectrumRobot` | Extends `TimedRobot`; manages global `SpectrumSubsystem` registration and calls `setupStates()`/`setupDefaultCommand()` on all subsystems |
| `SpectrumSubsystem` | Interface extending WPILib `Subsystem`; requires `setupStates()` and `setupDefaultCommand()` |
| `SpectrumState` | Named boolean state backed by a WPILib `Trigger`; supports timed, toggled, and command-driven state transitions |

---

### `hardware`
Low-level hardware wrappers and robot identity constants.

| Class | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `Rio` | Enum mapping RoboRIO serial numbers to robot identities; exposes `Rio.CANIVORE` and `Rio.RIO_CANBUS` bus name constants |
| `SpectrumCANcoder` | Configures a CANcoder and wires it into a `TalonFX` as Remote, Fused, or Sync feedback |
| `SpectrumCANcoderConfig` | Configuration holder for CANcoder offset, gear ratios, inversion, and attachment flag |
| `SpectrumServo` | PWM servo wrapper that also implements `Subsystem` |
| `TalonFXFactory` | Factory for creating `TalonFX` instances with consistent default configuration |

---

### `telemetry`
Logging, alerts, and runtime-tunable values.

| Class | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `Telemetry` | DogLog-based logging system; provides `log()`, `print()`, alert monitoring, and a `tunable()` NetworkTables subscriber factory |
| `BatteryLogger` | Accumulates per-subsystem current/power/energy each loop and logs totals via `logPower()` |
| `TuneValue` | SmartDashboard-backed tunable `double` for in-match parameter adjustment |

---

### `util`
General-purpose utilities, math, and data structures.

| Class | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `CachedDouble` | Wraps a `DoubleSupplier` and caches its value once per scheduler iteration |
| `CanDeviceId` | Typed CAN device identifier (device number + bus name) |
| `Conversions` | Unit conversion helpers (rotations ↔ inches, RPM ↔ RPS, etc.) |
| `CrashTracker` | Logs uncaught exceptions to a file on the RIO for post-match debugging |
| `Curve` / `ExpCurve` | Exponential input curve with deadband and scalar for joystick shaping |
| `Network` | NetworkTables helper utilities |
| `Trio` | Generic three-element tuple |
| `Util` | Miscellaneous utilities; exposes `Util.teleop`, `Util.autoMode`, `Util.disabled` triggers |
| `exceptions/KillRobotException` | Thrown to trigger a controlled robot shutdown on fatal errors |

---

### `mechanism`
Abstract base class for all TalonFX-driven mechanisms.

| Class | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `Mechanism` | Manages motor construction, follower configuration, control requests (voltage, velocity, motion magic, torque-FOC), sensor reads, soft limits, current limits, and simulation hooks. All hardware access is gated by `isAttached()`. |

Extend `Mechanism` and call its protected setters from command `execute()` bodies. Inner class `Mechanism.Config` holds all TalonFX configuration and PID/FF gains.

---

### `gamepads`
Xbox controller abstraction.

| Class | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `Gamepad` | Abstract class wrapping `CommandXboxController`; provides deadbanded/curved axis reads, bumper/trigger modifier combos, stick direction helpers, alliance-aware cardinals, and a `rumbleCommand()` factory |

---

### `leds`
AddressableLED subsystem with a pattern library.

| Class | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `SpectrumLEDs` | Manages an `AddressableLED` strip or view; provides `solid()`, `blink()`, `breathe()`, `rainbow()`, `chase()`, `wave()`, `bounce()`, `ombre()`, `countdown()`, and `stripe()` pattern factories |

Supports multi-zone strips via `AddressableLEDBufferView` and a priority system to prevent low-priority commands from overriding higher-priority ones.

---

### `sim`
Mechanism2d simulation helpers for visualizing robot mechanisms in DriverStation.

| Class | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `ArmSim` / `ArmConfig` | Simulates a rotating arm |
| `RollerSim` / `RollerConfig` | Simulates a spinning roller/wheel |
| `LinearSim` / `LinearConfig` | Simulates a linear extension |
| `Mount` / `Mountable` | Attachment point system for mounting sims onto other sims |
| `Circle` | Utility for drawing circular shapes in Mechanism2d |

---

### `swerve`
Swerve-specific utilities.

| Class | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `MapleSimSwerveDrivetrain` | Maple-Sim simulation bridge for CTRE swerve |
| `SysID` | SysID characterization routine wrapper (translation, rotation, steer) |

---

### `vision`
Limelight vision utilities.

| Class | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `Limelight` | Wrapper around `LimelightHelpers` with null-safe MegaTag1/MegaTag2 pose access, tag-count queries, and distance estimation |
| `LimelightHelpers` | Vendored Limelight utility library |
| `VisionLogger` | Logs vision pose estimates and tag data to telemetry |

## Usage

Copy the `spectrumLib` directory into your robot project under `src/main/java/frc/`. Extend `SpectrumRobot` as your robot base class, implement `SpectrumSubsystem` on each subsystem, and extend `Mechanism` for any TalonFX-driven mechanism.
